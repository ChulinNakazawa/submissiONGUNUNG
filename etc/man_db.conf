# This file is used by the man-db package to configure the man and cat paths.
# It is also used to provide a manpath for those without one by examining
# their PATH environment variable. For details see the manpath(5) man page.
#
# Lines beginning with `#' are comments and are ignored. Any combination of
# tabs or spaces may be used as `whitespace' separators.
#
# There are three mappings allowed in this file:
# --------------------------------------------------------
# MANDATORY_MANPATH			manpath_element
# MANPATH_MAP		path_element	manpath_element
# MANDB_MAP		global_manpath	[relative_catpath]
#---------------------------------------------------------
# every automatically generated MANPATH includes these fields
