#
# the format of this config file is pretty straightforward, and pretty concise.
# this sample is long and ugly only because it is copiously commented. comments
# must be on their own line. whitespace (apart from newlines) is ignored.  all
# regexps in this sample file use '/' as the separator, but any non-whitespace
# and non-alphanumeric character will do... to embed the separator in the
# regexp, escape it with a backslash. apart from that, regular expressions are
# as in python.
#
# the file consists of zero or more 'files:' blocks interleaved with zero or
# more 'ansi:' blocks. order of 'files:' blocks is important (first block with
# a matching regexp is used) while order of 'ansi:' blocks is irrelevant: they
# are treated as if they were defined as one at the top of the file.

# the 'files:' directive indicates the start of a new 'files:' block. it must
# be followed by a whitespace-separated list of file regexps to match this
# config. of course, you could put all the regexps in one and separate them
# with |, but this syntax is a little more pleasant, and i combine them anyway
# as i read the file. the token "stdin" is special and indicates that this
# config may  be used to color standard input. it is not a regexp, and regexps
# that match stdin (e.g., /stdin.*/) will not cause a config to be used for
# standard input.  the token "default" is treated similarly, but causes that
# config to be used when no other config matches (see below).
files: stdin
###files: stdin /stdout\.log/
   # an optional block of regexps to use for pre-color filtering. they are 
   # applied in order, so bear in mind that later regexps are applied to the 
   # output of earlier ones. the second part is substituted for the first 
   # part. you can use \1, \2, and so on to refer to groups.
   filters:
###      /continuum/c0nTiNuUm/
   # an optional block of regexps and associated colors. they are matched in 
   # order, with later matches coloring over earlier ones. expressions should 
   # have 0 or 1 groups... if an expression has zero groups, the whole match 
   # is colored, if it has one group, only the portion of the line matching 
   # the group is colored. this is a very simple-minded coloring system, and 
   # should probably be improved.
   # an unrecognized color name causes that line to be ignored.
   # built-in color names are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
   #    white, brightblack, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow, brightblue,
   #    brightmagenta, and brightcyan.
   colors:
      /^.*$/ white
      /^make.*:.*$/    brightblue
      /^make.*:.* Error [0-9]*$/    brightred
      /[ \t]-o [^ ]*/           cyan
      /.*: In function .*/ brightred
      /[A-Za-z0-9._]*:[0-9]*: .*/ brightred
	/\(.*\)/ white
      /`[^ ]*'/    green
      /^.*[Ww]arning.*$/       brightyellow
#      /.*[Ee]rror.*/         brightred
      /:[0-9]*:/ brightwhite

# a simple config to use for everything not covered above. if no default
# config is given, the default defaults to empty (no colors, no filters).
###files: default
###   colors:
###      /^.*$/             brightblack

# if you really want to override or extend the ansi escape sequences used, you
# can do so like this. an 'ansi:' block terminates a 'files:' block. it may
# appear before, between, or after any 'files:' blocks, and multiple ansi
# blocks will be concatenated and processed as one big one. if the same name
# is assigned multiple times, the last one is used. be aware than not all 
# ansi attributes are supported on all terminals. for instance, on my linux
# machine, blink (as in the following) works on the console, but not in an
# an xterm. also, be aware that you could really shoot yourself in the foot by
# setting the ansi sequences to key-remapping codes or something.
#
# note that you could also use this functionality to change the entire 
# behavior of mtail, printing out, e.g., html font tags instead of ansi 
# sequences. in that usage, it will help to know that the name "reset" is
# used for the sequence which terminates a block of colored text, and can
# also be overridden. by default, it is set to "[0m".
ansi: 
	/brightredblink/[5;1;31m/
